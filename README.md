GD50 using LOVE2D

I redid the statemachine because it initialized every time it entered (bad) so I could properly pause it

the shaders gave me some issues since I ended up using moonshine which made layering difficult so most of the 
extra classes were to help me deal with the layering in a semi-efficient manner, but honestly its a mess.
The only shader in use is gaussian blur because it looks nice when you pause the screen :)
